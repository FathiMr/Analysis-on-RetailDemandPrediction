# Analysis-on-RetailDemandPrediction

This repository aims at providing an analysis on the methods in a recent book named "Demand Prediction in Retail"
https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/demand-prediction-in-retail/19981986.

The goal of this project is to combine the proposed methods in this book to improve the prediction accuracy and compare the results with other methods like Deep Learning.
I also consider a case in which there is a lack of data (retail data for only a single year).
The data and primary codes are provided in the following link:
